The goal of this analysis is to understand user activity trends, identify correlations between different metrics, and suggest improvements in health and fitness programs.\n","\n","# Dataset Contents\n","The dataset includes the following files:\n","\n","- **CSV Files**: These files contain raw data collected from Bellabeat devices, including user activity data (steps, sleep, calories, etc.). The data is cleaned and processed for analysis.\n","- **RMarkdown Files**: These files contain the R code used for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. The code is structured in RMarkdown files (intro.rmd, processing.rmd, analyze_share.rmd) and corresponding HTML reports.\n","- **Visualizations**: Graphs and charts created during the analysis, including activity trends and correlations between different metrics.\n","\n","# Data Source\n","The data is publicly available through my GitHub repository: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/yevgeniiakynash/bellabeat_project). The dataset contains both raw and cleaned data for analysis, as well as R scripts and visualizations.\n","\n","# How to Use\n","1. Download the dataset files directly from Kaggle.\n","2. Load the data into R or any other data analysis tool you prefer.\n","3. Reproduce the analysis by running the RMarkdown files, which contain the full analysis pipeline, including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations.\n","4. Explore the trends and insights generated from the Bellabeat activity data, and use it to inform decisions in health and fitness programs or further research.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"id":"7b3e4202","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2025-03-30T15:18:58.103293Z","iopub.status.busy":"2025-03-30T15:18:58.101001Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-03-30T15:19:20.632537Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-03-30T15:19:20.628471Z"},"papermill":{"duration":22.543592,"end_time":"2025-03-30T15:19:20.637043","exception":false,"start_time":"2025-03-30T15:18:58.093451","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["###
